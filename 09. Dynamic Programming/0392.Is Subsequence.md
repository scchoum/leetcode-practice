## 392. Is Subsequence

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence/)

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if `s` is a **subsequence** of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

* 0 <= s.length <= 100
* 0 <= t.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming `s`, say `s`<sub>`1`</sub>`, s`<sub>`2`</sub>`, ..., s`<sub>`k`</sub> where `k >= 10`<sup>`9`</sup>, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

## Solution

**java :**

first solution (Dynamic Programming):
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int[][] dp = new int[s.length() + 1][t.length() + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < t.length(); j++) {
                if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = dp[i][j] + 1;
                }
                else {
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = dp[i + 1][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[dp.length - 1][dp[0].length - 1] == s.length();
    }
}
```

second solution (Two Pointers):
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; i < s.length() && j < t.length(); j++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) i++;
        }
        return i == s.length();
    }
}
```
