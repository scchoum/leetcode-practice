## 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= prices.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 0 <= prices[i] <= 10<sup>4</sup>

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        if (prices.length == 1) return 0;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][2];
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < dp.length; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], -prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i]);
        }
        return dp[dp.length - 1][1];
    }
}
```
