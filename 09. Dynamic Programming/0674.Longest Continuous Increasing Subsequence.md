## 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest **continuous increasing subsequence** (i.e. subarray). The subsequence must be **strictly** increasing.

A **continuous increasing subsequence** is defined by two indices `l` and `r` (`l < r`) such that it is `[nums[l], nums[l + 1], ..., nums[r - 1], nums[r]]` and for each `l <= i < r`, `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5] with length 3.
Even though [1,3,5,7] is an increasing subsequence, it is not continuous as elements 5 and 7 are separated by element
4.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2] with length 1. Note that it must be strictly
increasing.
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* -10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        
        int result = 1;
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1;
            }
            else {
                dp[i] = 1;
            }
            result = Math.max(result, dp[i]);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
