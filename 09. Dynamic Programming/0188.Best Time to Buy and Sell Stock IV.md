## 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/)

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

**Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Example 1:
```
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

### Constraints:

* 0 <= k <= 100
* 0 <= prices.length <= 1000
* 0 <= prices[i] <= 1000

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        if (k == 0 || prices.length <= 1) return 0;
        int[][] dp = new int[prices.length][2 * k];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) dp[0][2 * i] = -prices[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < dp.length; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][0], -prices[i]);
            dp[i][1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][1], dp[i - 1][0] + prices[i]);
            for (int j = 1; j < k; j++) {
                dp[i][2 * j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][2 * j], dp[i - 1][2 * j - 1] - prices[i]);
                dp[i][2 * j + 1] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][2 * j +1], dp[i - 1][2 * j] + prices[i]);
            }
        }
        return dp[dp.length - 1][dp[0].length - 1];
    }
} 
```
