## 37. Sudoku Solver

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/)

Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.
The `'.'` character indicates empty cells.

### Example 1:
```
Input: board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
Explanation: The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:
```

### Constraints:

* board.length == 9
* board[i].length == 9
* board[i][j] is a digit or '.'.
* It is guaranteed that the input board has only one solution.

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public void solveSudoku(char[][] board) {
        backtracking(board);
    }
    
    private boolean backtracking(char[][] board) {
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] != '.') continue;
                
                for (char num = '1'; num <= '9'; num++) {
                    if (isValid(board, i, j, num)) {
                        board[i][j] = num;
                        if (backtracking(board)) return true;
                        board[i][j] = '.';
                    }
                }
                
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    private boolean isValid(char[][] board, int r, int c, char num) {
        for (int i = 0; i < board[0].length; i++) {
            if (board[r][i] == num) return false;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            if (board[i][c] == num) return false;
        }
        
        int startX = (r / 3) * 3;
        int startY = (c / 3) * 3;
        for (int i = startX; i < startX + 3; i++) {
            for (int j = startY; j < startY + 3; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == num) return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```
