## 11. Container With Most Water

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

### Example 1:
```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

* n == height.length
* 2 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 0 <= height[i] <= 104

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int result = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            result = Math.max(result, Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left));
            
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                int preHeight = height[left++];
                while (height[left] <= preHeight && left < right) left++;
            }
            else {
                int preHeight = height[right--];
                while (height[right] <= preHeight && left < right) right--;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
