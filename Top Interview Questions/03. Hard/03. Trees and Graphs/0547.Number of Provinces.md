## 547. Number of Provinces

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/submissions/)

There are `n` cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city `a` is connected directly with city `b`, and city `b` is connected directly with city `c`, then city `a` is connected indirectly with city `c`.

A **province** is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an `n x n` matrix `isConnected` where `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> city and the `j`<sup>`th`</sup> city are directly connected, and `isConnected[i][j] = 0` otherwise.

Return the total number of **provinces**.

### Example 1:
```
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 200
* n == isConnected.length
* n == isConnected[i].length
* isConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.
* isConnected[i][i] == 1
* isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] isConnected) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[isConnected.length];
        int num = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < isConnected.length; i++) {
            if (visited[i]) continue;
            num++;
            dfs(isConnected, visited, i);
        }
        return num;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int[][] isConnected, boolean[] visited, int source) {
        if (visited[source]) return;
        
        visited[source] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < isConnected.length; i++) {
            if (isConnected[source][i] == 1) {
                dfs(isConnected, visited, i);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
