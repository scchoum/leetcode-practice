## 200. Number of Islands

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

### Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

### Constraints:

* m == grid.length
* n == grid[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 300
* grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'.

## Solution

**java :**

first solution:
```java
class Solution {
    
    char[][] grid;
    int rows;
    int cols;
    
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        this.grid = grid;
        rows = grid.length;
        cols = grid[0].length;
        int nums = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    nums++;
                    search(i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        return nums;
    }
    
    private void search(int i, int j) {
        if (i >= 0 && i < rows && j >=0 && j < cols) {
            if (grid[i][j] == '0') return;
            grid[i][j] = '0';
            search(i, j - 1);
            search(i, j + 1);
            search(i - 1, j);
            search(i + 1, j);
        }
    }
}
```
