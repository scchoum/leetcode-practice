## 69. Sqrt(x)

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)

Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return the square root of `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only **the integer part** of the result is returned.

**Note**: You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

### Constraints:

* 0 <= x <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        return (int) Math.sqrt(x);
    }
}
```

second solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        int mid = x / 2;
        int start = 1;
        int end = mid;
        while (mid > 0) {
            if (mid == x / mid) return mid;
            
            if (mid > x / mid) {
                end = mid;
            }
            else if (mid < x / mid) {
                start = mid;
            }
            mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
            if (mid == start) return mid;
        }
        return x;
    }
}
```
