## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:

* 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

## Solution

**java :**

first solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int[] map = new int[127];
        int slow = 0;
        int fast = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int result = 0;
        for (; fast < s.length(); fast++) {
            map[s.charAt(fast)]++;
            count++;

            while(map[s.charAt(fast)] > 1 || map[s.charAt(slow)] > 1) {
                map[s.charAt(slow)]--;
                slow++;
                count--;
            }
            result = Math.max(count, result);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
