## 461. Hamming Distance

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/)

The `Hamming distance` between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, return the **Hamming distance** between them.

### Example 1:
```
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑
The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: x = 3, y = 1
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

* 0 <= x, y <= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1

## Solution

**java :**

first solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int result = 0;
        int n = x ^ y;
        while (n > 0) {
            result += n & 1;
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
