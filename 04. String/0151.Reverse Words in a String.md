## 151. Reverse Words in a String

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/)

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return *a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.*

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
Output: "Alice Loves Bob"
```

### Example 5:
```
Input: s = "Alice does not even like bob"
Output: "bob like even not does Alice"
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 104
* s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
* There is at least one word in s.

## Solution

**java :**

first solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        char[] c = s.toCharArray();
        
        //remove head and tail space
        int start = 0;
        while (' ' == c[start]) start++;
        
        int end = s.length() - 1;
        while (' ' == c[end]) end--;
        
        //remove middle redundant space
        int slow = start;
        for (int fast = start; fast <= end; fast++) {
            while (' ' == c[fast] && ' ' == c[fast-1]) {
                fast++;
            }
            c[slow++] = c[fast];
        }
        
        //reverse each words
        int record = start;
        for (int i = start; i < slow; i++) {
            if (' ' == c[i]) {
                reverseCharArray(c, record, i - 1);
                record = i + 1;
            }
            else if (i == slow - 1) {
                reverseCharArray(c, record, i);
            }
        }
        //reverse whole sentence
        reverseCharArray(c, start, slow - 1);
        
        return String.valueOf(c, start, slow - start);
    }
    
    private void reverseCharArray(char[] charArray, int start, int end) {
        char temp;
        while (start < end) {
            temp = charArray[start];
            charArray[start++] = charArray[end];
            charArray[end--] = temp;
        }
    }
}
