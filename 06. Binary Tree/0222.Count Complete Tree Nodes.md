## 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

Given the root of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2`<sup>`h`</sup> nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>].
* 0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* The tree is guaranteed to be complete.

## Solution

**java :**

first solution (O(n)):
```java
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        
        return countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right) + 1;
    }
}
```

second solution (O(logn * logn)):
```java
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        
        TreeNode leftNode = root.left;
        TreeNode rightNode = root.right;
        
        int leftHeight = 1;
        int rightHeight = 1;
        
        while (leftNode != null) {
            leftHeight++;
            leftNode = leftNode.left;
        }
        
        while (rightNode != null) {
            rightHeight++;
            rightNode = rightNode.right;
        }
        
        if (leftHeight == rightHeight) {
            return (int) Math.pow(2, leftHeight) - 1;
        }
        
        return countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right) + 1;
    }
}
```
