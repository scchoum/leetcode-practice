## 535. Encode and Decode TinyURL

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-tinyurl/)

```
Note: This is a companion problem to the System Design problem: Design TinyURL.
```

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`. Design a class to encode a URL and decode a tiny URL.

There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

Implement the `Solution` class:

* `Solution()` Initializes the object of the system.
* `String encode(String longUrl)` Returns a tiny URL for the given `longUrl`.
* `String decode(String shortUrl)` Returns the original long URL for the given `shortUrl`. It is guaranteed that the given `shortUrl` was encoded by the same object.

### Example 1:
```
Input: url = "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"
Output: "https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl"

Explanation:
Solution obj = new Solution();
string tiny = obj.encode(url); // returns the encoded tiny url.
string ans = obj.decode(tiny); // returns the original url after deconding it.
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= url.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* url is guranteed to be a valid URL.

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
public class Codec {
    
    int key = 1;
    Map<Integer, String> map = new HashMap<>();

    // Encodes a URL to a shortened URL.
    public String encode(String longUrl) {
        map.put(key, longUrl);
        return Integer.toString(key++);
    }

    // Decodes a shortened URL to its original URL.
    public String decode(String shortUrl) {
        return map.get(Integer.parseInt(shortUrl));
    }
}

```
