## 1510. Stone Game IV

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iv/)

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing **any** non-zero **square number** of stones in the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game otherwise return `false`, assuming both players play optimally.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone winning the game because Bob doesn't have any moves.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice can only remove 1 stone, after that Bob removes the last one winning the game (2 -> 1 -> 0).
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: n is already a perfect square, Alice can win with one move, removing 4 stones (4 -> 0).
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup>

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean winnerSquareGame(int n) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            if (!dp[i]) {
                for (int j = 1; i + j * j <= n; j++) {
                    dp[i + j * j] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```
