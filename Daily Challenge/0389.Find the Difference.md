## 389. Find the Difference

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

You are given two strings `s` and `t`.

String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then add one more letter at a random position.

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"
```

### Constraints:

* 0 <= s.length <= 1000
* t.length == s.length + 1
* s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int[] map = new int[26];
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            map[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            map[c - 'a']--;
            if (map[c - 'a'] < 0) return c;
        }
        
        return 'a';
    }
}
