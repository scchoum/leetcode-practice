## 997. Find the Town Judge

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/)

In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [a`<sub>`i`</sub>`, b`<sub>`i`</sub>`]` representing that the person labeled `a`<sub>`i`</sub> trusts the person labeled `b`<sub>`i`</sub>.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return `-1` otherwise.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
Output: 2
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 3
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= n <= 1000
* 0 <= trust.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* trust[i].length == 2
* All the pairs of trust are unique.
* a<sub>i</sub> != b<sub>i</sub>
* 1 <= a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub> <= n

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        int[] map = new int[n + 1];
        
        for (int[] trustItem : trust) {
            map[trustItem[0]]--;
            map[trustItem[1]]++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < map.length; i++) {
            if (map[i] == n - 1) return i;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```
