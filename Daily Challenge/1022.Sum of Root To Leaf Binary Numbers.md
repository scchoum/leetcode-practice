## 1022. Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-root-to-leaf-binary-numbers/)

You are given the `root` of a binary tree where each node has a value `0` or `1`. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.

* For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is 13.
For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. Return the sum of these numbers.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bits** integer.

### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 22
Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [0]
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
* Node.val is 0 or 1.

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    
    int result;
    
    public int sumRootToLeaf(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        result = 0;
        traversal(root, 0);
        return result;
    }
    
    private void traversal(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        sum = sum * 2 + root.val;
        
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            result += sum;
            return;
        }
        
        if (root.left != null) traversal(root.left, sum);
        if (root.right != null) traversal(root.right, sum);
        
    }
}
```
