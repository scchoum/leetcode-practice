## 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60/)

You are given a list of songs where the i<sup>th</sup> song has a duration of `time[i]` seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by `60`. Formally, we want the number of indices `i`, `j` such that `i < j` with `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: time = [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= time.length <= 6 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= time[i] <= 500

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        int[] map = new int[60];
        for (int num : time) {
            map[num % 60]++;
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        result += accumulateMap(map[0]);
        result += accumulateMap(map[30]);
        
        for (int i = 1; i < 30; i++) {
            result += map[i] * map[60 - i];
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    private int accumulateMap(int num) {
        return num * (num - 1) / 2;
    }
}
```
