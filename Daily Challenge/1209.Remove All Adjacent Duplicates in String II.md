## 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string-ii/)

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`, a `k` **duplicate removal** consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` **duplicate removals** on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* 2 <= k <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* s only contains lower case English letters.

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String s, int k) {
        Deque<CharCounter> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (!deque.isEmpty() && c == deque.peek().getChar()) {
                if (deque.peek().getCount() == k - 1) {
                    deque.pop();
                }
                else {
                    deque.peek().count();
                }
            }
            else {
                deque.push(new CharCounter(c));
            }
        }
        
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        while (!deque.isEmpty()) {
            builder.append(deque.pollLast());
        }
        return builder.toString();
    }
    
    private class CharCounter {
        private char c;
        private int count;
        
        public CharCounter(char c) {
            this.c = c;
            this.count = 1;
        }
        
        public char getChar() {
            return c;
        }
        
        public int getCount() {
            return count;
        }
        
        public void count() {
            count++;
        }
        
        @Override
        public String toString() {
            return Character.toString(c).repeat(count);
        }
    }
}
```
