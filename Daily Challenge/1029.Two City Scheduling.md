## 1029. Two City Scheduling

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-city-scheduling/)

A company is planning to interview `2n` people. Given the array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCost`<sub>`i`</sub>`, bCost`<sub>`i`</sub>`]`, the cost of flying the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> person to city `a` is `aCost`<sub>`i`</sub>, and the cost of flying the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> person to city `b` is `bCost`<sub>`i`</sub>.

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly n people arrive in each city.

### Example 1:
```
Input: costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[400,50],[30,20]]
Output: 110
Explanation: 
The first person goes to city A for a cost of 10.
The second person goes to city A for a cost of 30.
The third person goes to city B for a cost of 50.
The fourth person goes to city B for a cost of 20.

The total minimum cost is 10 + 30 + 50 + 20 = 110 to have half the people interviewing in each city.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: costs = [[259,770],[448,54],[926,667],[184,139],[840,118],[577,469]]
Output: 1859
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: costs = [[515,563],[451,713],[537,709],[343,819],[855,779],[457,60],[650,359],[631,42]]
Output: 3086
```

### Constraints:

* 2 * n == costs.length
* 2 <= costs.length <= 100
* costs.length is even.
* 1 <= aCost<sub>i</sub>, bCost<sub>i</sub> <= 1000

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int twoCitySchedCost(int[][] costs) {
        int[][] record = new int[costs.length][costs[0].length];
        for (int i = 0; i < costs.length; i++) {
            record[i][0] = i;
            record[i][1] = costs[i][0] - costs[i][1];
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(record, (o1, o2) -> Integer.compare(o1[1], o2[1]));
        
        int cost = 0;
        int n = costs.length / 2;
        for (int i = 0; i < costs.length; i++) {
            if (i < n) cost += costs[record[i][0]][0];
            else cost += costs[record[i][0]][1];
        }
        return cost;
    }
}
```

second solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int twoCitySchedCost(int[][] costs) {
        int n = costs.length / 2;
        int cost = 0;
        int[] refund = new int[2 * n];
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            refund[i] = costs[i][1] - costs[i][0];
            cost += costs[i][0];
        }
        Arrays.sort(refund);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cost += refund[i];
        }
        return cost;
    }
}
```
