## 797. All Paths From Source to Target

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-paths-from-source-to-target/)

Given a directed acyclic graph (**DAG**) of n nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in **any order**.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).

### Example 1:
```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: graph = [[1],[]]
Output: [[0,1]]
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[2],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,2,3],[0,3]]
```

### Example 5:
```
Input: graph = [[1,3],[2],[3],[]]
Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,3]]
```

### Constraints:

* n == graph.length
* 2 <= n <= 15
* 0 <= graph[i][j] < n
* graph[i][j] != i (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
* All the elements of graph[i] are unique.
* The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.

## Solution

**java :**

first solution:
```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

class Solution {
    
    List<List<Integer>> result;
    List<Integer> record;
    
    public List<List<Integer>> allPathsSourceTarget(int[][] graph) {
        result = new ArrayList<>();
        record = new ArrayList<>();
        record.add(0);
        backTracking(graph, 0);
        return result;
    }
    
    private void backTracking(int[][] graph, int current) {
        if (current >= graph.length - 1) {
            result.add(new ArrayList(record));
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < graph[current].length; i++) {
            record.add(graph[current][i]);
            backTracking(graph, graph[current][i]);
            record.remove(record.size() - 1);
        }
    }
}
```
