## 605. Can Place Flowers

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers/)

You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return if `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

### Example 1:
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 10<sup>4</sup>
* flowerbed[i] is 0 or 1.
* There are no two adjacent flowers in flowerbed.
* 0 <= n <= flowerbed.length

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        if (n == 0) return true;
        int count = 0;
        
        if (flowerbed[0] == 0) count++;
        for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0) count++;
            else {
                n -= (count - 1) / 2;
                count = 0;
                if (n <= 0) return true;
            }
        }
        if (flowerbed[flowerbed.length - 1] == 0) count++;
        
        return (n - (count - 1) / 2) <= 0;
    }
}
```
