## 1094. Car Pooling

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/car-pooling/)

There is a car with `capacity` empty seats. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

You are given the integer `capacity` and an array `trips` where `trip[i] = [numPassengers`<sub>`i`</sub>`, from`<sub>`i`</sub>`, to`<sub>`i`</sub>`]` indicates that the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> trip has `numPassengers`<sub>`i`</sub> passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are `from`<sub>`i`</sub> and `to`<sub>`i`</sub> respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from the car's initial location.

Return `true` if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:
```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
Output: false
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
Output: true
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= trips.length <= 1000
* trips[i].length == 3
* 1 <= numPassengers<sub>i</sub> <= 100
* 0 <= from<sub>i</sub> < to<sub>i</sub> <= 1000
* 1 <= capacity <= 10<sup>5</sup>

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
        int[] map = new int[1001];
        int end = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < trips.length; i++) {
            map[trips[i][1]] += trips[i][0];
            map[trips[i][2]] -= trips[i][0];
            end = Math.max(end, trips[i][2]);
        }
        
        int record = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= end; i++) {
            record += map[i];
            if (record > capacity) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

second solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
        int[] map = new int[1001];
        for (int[] trip : trips) {
            for (int i = trip[1]; i < trip[2]; i++) {
                map[i] += trip[0];
                if (map[i] > capacity) return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
