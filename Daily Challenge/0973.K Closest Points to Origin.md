## 973. K Closest Points to Origin

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [x`<sub>`i`</sub>`, y`<sub>`i`</sub>`]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.

The distance between two points on the **X-Y** plane is the Euclidean distance (i`.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)`<sup>`2`</sup>` + (y1 - y2)`<sup>`2`</sup>`)`.

You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be **unique** (except for the order that it is in).

### Example 1:
```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation:
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= k <= points.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* -10<sup>4</sup> < xi, yi < 10<sup>4</sup>

# Solution

**java :**

first solution (O(n)):
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int k) {
        int[][] result = new int[k][2];
        PriorityQueue<int[]> queue =
            new PriorityQueue<>((o1, o2) -> o1[1] - o2[1]);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            queue.offer(new int[]{i, points[i][0] * points[i][0] + points[i][1] * points[i][1]});
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
            result[i] = points[queue.poll()[0]];
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

second solution (O(logn)):
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int k) {
        int pivot = points.length;
        int left = 0;
        int right = points.length - 1;
        while (pivot != k) {
            pivot = partition(points, left, right);
            
            if (pivot < k) left = pivot;
            else right = pivot - 1;
        }
        return Arrays.copyOf(points, k);
    }
    
    private int partition(int[][] points, int left, int right) {
        int pivotDistance = countDistance(points[right]);
        int index = left - 1;
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            if (countDistance(points[i]) <= pivotDistance) {
                index++;
                int[] temp = points[index];
                points[index] = points[i];
                points[i] = temp;
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
    
    private int countDistance(int[] point) {
        return point[0] * point[0] + point[1] * point[1];
    }
}
