## 875. Koko Eating Bananas

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)

Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

Return the minimum integer `k` such that she can eat all the bananas within `h` hours.

### Example 1:
```
Input: piles = [3,6,7,11], h = 8
Output: 4
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 5
Output: 30
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], h = 6
Output: 23
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= piles.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* piles.length <= h <= 10<sup>9</sup>
* 1 <= piles[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int minEatingSpeed(int[] piles, int h) {
        int maxVal = piles[0];
        long sum = 0;
        for (int pile : piles) {
            maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, pile);
            sum += pile;
        }
        int minVal = (int) ((sum - 1) / h + 1);
        
        return binarySearch(piles, h, minVal, maxVal);
    }
    
    private int binarySearch(int[] piles, int h, int minVal, int maxVal) {
        if (minVal >= maxVal) return minVal;
        
        int k = minVal + (maxVal - minVal) / 2;
        if (canEatAll(piles, h, k)) return binarySearch(piles, h, minVal, k);
        else return binarySearch(piles, h, k + 1, maxVal);
    }
    
    private boolean canEatAll(int[] piles, int h, int k) {
        int hour = 0;
        for (int pile : piles) {
            hour += (pile - 1) / k + 1;
        }
        return h >= hour;
    }
}
