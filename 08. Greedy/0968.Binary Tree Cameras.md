## 968. Binary Tree Cameras

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/)

You are given the `root` of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
```

### Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
* Node.val == 0

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    
    int result;
    
    public int minCameraCover(TreeNode root) {
        result = 0;
        if (traversal(root) == 0) {
            result++;
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    private int traversal(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 2;
        
        int left = traversal(root.left);
        int right = traversal(root.right);
        
        if (left == 2 && right == 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        if (left == 0 || right == 0) {
            result++;
            return 1;
        }
        
        if (left == 1 || right == 1) {
            return 2;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```
