## 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

[leetcode connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/non-overlapping-intervals/)

Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start`<sub>`i`</sub>`, end`<sub>`i`</sub>`]`, return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

### Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

### Constraints:

* 1 <= intervals.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>
* intervals[i].length == 2
* -5 * 10<sup>4</sup> <= starti < endi <= 5 * 10<sup>4</sup>

## Solution

**java :**

first solution :
```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length < 2) return 0;
        
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (o1, o2) -> Integer.compare(o1[1], o2[1]));
        
        int count = 1;
        int right = intervals[0][1];
        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] >= right) {
                count++;
                right = intervals[i][1];
                
            }
        }
        return intervals.length - count;
    }
}
```
